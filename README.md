This extension allows you to see the total length of a YouTube playlist. Why did I make this? Before jumping into playlists, I often want to ensure that they aren't too long. One day, I found an interesting looking playlist with 22 videos of wildly varying lengths. After summing the durations of the first 12 or so videos, I got fed up and made this.
